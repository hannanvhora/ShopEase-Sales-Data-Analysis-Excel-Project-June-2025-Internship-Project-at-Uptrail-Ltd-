## 👨‍💻 My Contributions
- Took full ownership of the data cleaning, transformation, and visual reporting.
- Identified and corrected missing and duplicate values using Power Query.
- Created multiple pivot tables to analyze:
  - Monthly sales performance
  - Category-based revenue trends
  - Regional customer behavior
- Extracted key insights such as:
  - **January** was the best-performing month (1,500 units sold)
  - **March** was the lowest-performing (275 units)
  - **Electronics** made up 95.9% of total revenue
  - Regional variations indicated Clothing interest was higher in the **East**
- Proposed marketing, inventory, and pricing strategies for sales optimization.
- Drafted a formal insights report with professional tone and structure.

## 📈 Key Insights
- Targeted marketing during January and June is critical.
- Inventory stock must scale with seasonal peaks.
- Region-specific campaigns (e.g., Clothing in East) can boost sales.
- March requires promotional efforts to recover from seasonal lows.
